    Title: Server.py
    Description: This is a TCP Server program that will connect to two different
    clients simultaneously. The server will receive one message from each server 
    and will process each message. The server will then send the messages back to
    the correct client.

    NOTE: To Run Please use Python3 command. This program was written and tested with Python 3.6.9 and higher.    


    Answer to question 11 of the grading rubric:
    11. (25 points) Explain why you need multithreading to solve this problem. Put this in a
    comment at the top of your server code.

    Multiple parts of this program need to run concurrently in order to share data between threads. 
    The use of multithreading creates the illusion of multitasking since the default cpu setting of Mininet has one processor. 
    This program simultaneously executes two clients, which are both communicating with one server. 
    Because of the nature of this program, the two clients must run concurrently while communicating with the server. 
    In the main method of the server program, a while loop will continuously run in the background, waiting for clients to request connections. 
    As the server opens TCP connections with each client, it must create a new thread to run each connection. 
    Because they are all running in their own threads, each connection can then run a while loop and receive 
    transmissions from the client at the same time and thus one client doesnâ€™t have to wait for the other one to finish running.
